    Matrix transformations
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      The past few sections introduced us to vectors and linear
      combinations as a means of thinking geometrically about the
      solutions to a linear system.  Using matrix-vector
      multiplication, we rewrote a linear system as a
      matrix equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> and used the concepts of
      span and linear independence to understand when solutions exist
      and when they are unique.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this section, we will explore how matrix-vector
      multiplication defines certain types of functions, which we call
      <em> matrix transformations</em>, similar to those encountered
      in previous algebra courses.  In particular, we will develop
      some algebraic tools for thinking about matrix transformations
      and look at some motivating examples.  In the next section, we
      will see how matrix transformations describe important geometric
      operations and how they are used in computer animation.
    </p>

    <exploration>
      <statement>
      <p> We will begin by considering a more familiar situation;
      namely, the function <m>f(x) = x^2</m>, which takes a real
      number <m>x</m> as an input and produces its square <m>x^2</m>
      as its output.
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> What is the value of <m>f(3)</m>? </p></li>

	<li><p> Can we solve the equation <m>f(x) = 4</m>?  If so, is
	the solution unique? </p></li>

	<li><p> Can we solve the equation <m>f(x) = -10</m>?  If so, is
	the solution unique? </p></li>

    <subsection>
      <title> Matrix transformations </title>

      <p> In the preview activity, we considered simple linear
      functions, such as <m>g(x) = \frac12 x</m> whose graph is the
      line shown in <xref ref="fig-graph-line" />.  We construct a
      function like this by choosing a number <m>m</m>;  when given
      an input
      <m>x</m>, the output <m>g(x) = mx</m> is formed by multiplying
      <m>x</m> by <m>m</m>.

	<idx> matrix transformation </idx>
	In this section, we will consider functions defined through
	matrix-vector multiplication.  That is, we will
	choose a matrix <m>A</m>; when given an input <m>\xvec</m>,
	the function <m>T(\xvec) = A\xvec</m> forms the product
	<m>A\xvec</m> as its output.  Such a function is called a
	<em>matrix transformation</em>.  
      </p>

	<p> In this activity, we will look at some examples of matrix

      <p>
	Let's discuss a few of the issues that appear in this
	activity.  First, if <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix,
	we can form the matrix product <m>A\xvec</m> when <m>\xvec</m>
	is an <m>n</m>-dimensional vector in <m>\real^n</m>.  The
	resulting product <m>A\xvec</m> is an <m>m</m>-dimensional
	vector in <m>\real^m</m>.  If
	<m>T(\xvec) = A\xvec</m>, we therefore write
	<m>T:\real^n\to\real^m</m> meaning <m>T</m> takes vectors in
	<m>\real^n</m> as inputs and produces vectors in
	<m>\real^m</m> as outputs.  For instance, if
	<me>
	  A=\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	  4 \amp 0 \amp -3 \amp 2 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp 3 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>,
	then <m>T:\real^4\to\real^2</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
	If we know the matrix <m>A</m>, then we can form the matrix
	transformation <m>T(\xvec) = A\xvec</m>.  However, if we only
	know the values of the matrix transformation <m>T</m>, we
	can reconstruct the matrix <m>A</m>.  The key is to remember
	that matrix-vector multiplication constructs a linear
	combination.  For instance, if <m>A</m> is a
	<m>m\times2</m> matrix <m>A=\left[\begin{array}{rr} \vvec_1
	\amp \vvec_2 \end{array}\right]</m>, then
	<me>
	  T\left(\twovec{1}{0}\right) =
	  \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2
	  \end{array}\right]\twovec{1}{0} = 1\vvec_1 + 0\vvec_2 =
	  \vvec_1
	</me>.
	  That is, we can find the first column of <m>A</m> by
	  evaluating <m>T\left(\twovec{1}{0}\right)</m>.  Similarly,
	  the second column of <m>A</m> is found by evaluating
	  <m>T\left(\twovec{0}{1}\right)</m>. 
      </p>

      <p>
	More generally, we will write
	<me>
	  \evec_1 = \left[\begin{array}{r}
	  1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{array}\right],
	  \evec_2 = \left[\begin{array}{r}
	  0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{array}\right],
	  \ldots,
	  \evec_n = \left[\begin{array}{r}
	  0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 1 \end{array}\right]
	</me>
	so that
	<me>
	  T(\evec_j) = \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	  \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \ldots \amp \vvec_n
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \evec_j = \vvec_j
	</me>.
	This means that the <m>j^{th}</m> column of <m>A</m> is found
	by evaluating <m>T(\evec_j)</m>.  We record this fact in the
	following proposition.
      </p>

      <proposition xml:id="prop-linear-trans-columns">
	<statement>
	  <p> If <m>T:\real^n\to\real^m</m> is a matrix
	  transformation given by <m>T(\xvec) = A\xvec</m>,
	  then the matrix <m>A</m> has columns <m>T(\evec_j)</m>;
	  that is,
	  <me>
	    A = \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	    T(\evec_1) \amp T(\evec_2) \amp \ldots \amp T(\evec_n)

      the following activity.</p>

	<p> Suppose that we work for a company that produces baked

	  <p> We combine the number of hours the two plants operate

	    <li><p>
	      As before, we have <m>B=\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	      4 \amp 1 \amp 1 \\
	      2 \amp 1 \amp 2 \\
	      \end{array}\right]</m>.
	    </p></li>

	    <li><p> We begin with <m>\xvec=\twovec{30}{20}</m> so that
	    <m>\threevec{C}{D}{E} = T(\xvec)=A\xvec</m>.  Then the
	    amount of ingredients required is <m>R(T(\xvec)) =
	    BA\xvec</m>.  We find that <m>BA\xvec =
	    \twovec{6400}{6500}</m>.
	    </p></li>

	    <li><p>
	      The matrix defining <m>P</m> is
	      <m>BA =
	      \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	      120 \amp 140 \\
	      130 \amp 130 \\
	      \end{array}\right]\text{.}
	      </m>
	    </p></li>
	  </ol></p>
	</solution>
	      
      </activity>

      <p> In this activity, we considered two matrix transformations
      and constructed a third using composition.  We began with the
      matrix transformation <m>T</m> that tells us the number of baked
      goods produced when the plants are operated for a certain amount
      of time.  If we write the times as <m>\xvec =
      \twovec{x_1}{x_2}</m>, then <m>\twovec{1}{0}</m> represents the
      situation where Plant 1 operates for one hour and Plant 2 is not
      operated.  We are told that, in this one hour, Plant 1 produces
      10 cakes, 50 donuts, and 30 eclairs.  We therefore have
      <me>
	T\left(\twovec{1}{0}\right) = \threevec{10}{50}{30}
      </me>.
      Similarly, 
      <me>
	T\left(\twovec{0}{1}\right) = \threevec{20}{30}{30}
      </me>,
      which tells us that the matrix <m>A</m> that defines <m>T</m> is
      <me>
	A=\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	10 \amp 20 \\
	50 \amp 30 \\
	30 \amp 30 \\
	\end{array}\right]\text{.}
      </me>
      </p>

      <p> In the same way, we use the matrix transformation
      <m>R\left(\threevec{C}{D}{E}\right) = \twovec{F}{S}</m> to
      describe the ingredients
      required to make a certain number of cakes, donuts, and
      eclairs.  We see that
      <me>
	R\left(\threevec{1}{0}{0}\right) = \twovec{4}{2},\qquad
	R\left(\threevec{0}{1}{0}\right) = \twovec{1}{1},\qquad
	R\left(\threevec{0}{0}{1}\right) = \twovec{1}{2}\text{,}
      </me>
      which means that the matrix defining <m>R</m> is
      <me>
	B = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	4 \amp 1 \amp 1 \\
	2 \amp 1 \amp 2 \\
	\end{array}\right]\text{.}
      </me>
      </p>

      <p> Finally, we wish to compose these two matrix
      transformations.  For instance, if we operate the plants for times
      given by the vector <m>\xvec</m>, we would like to know the
      required amounts of the ingredients.  To determine this, notice
      that <m>T(\xvec) = A\xvec</m> tells us how many cakes, donuts,
      and eclairs we produce.  The ingredients required are then given
      by
      <me>R(T(\xvec)) = R(A\xvec) = B(A\xvec) = BA\xvec</me>.
      Notice that the
      matrix that defines the composition is given by the product of
      the two matrices defining the matrix transformations.</p>

      <p> In this case, we have
      <me>
	BA =
	\left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	4 \amp 1 \amp 1 \\
	2 \amp 1 \amp 2 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	10 \amp 20 \\
	50 \amp 30 \\
	30 \amp 30 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	= \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	120 \amp 140 \\
	130  \amp 130 \\
	\end{array}\right]
      </me>.
      This means that the matrix transformation that tells us the
      required amount of ingredients given the amount of time that the
      plants are operated is described by
      <me>
	P(\xvec) = R\circ T(\xvec)= \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	120 \amp 140 \\
	130 \amp 130 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	\twovec{x_1}{x_2}
	= \twovec{F}{S}\text{.}
      </me>
      For instance, if Plant 1 operates for 30 hours and Plant 2
      for 20 hours, we have
      <me>
	P\left(\twovec{30}{20}\right) =
	\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	120 \amp 140 \\
	130 \amp 130 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	\twovec{30}{20}
	= \twovec{6400}{6500}\text{.}
      </me>
      In other words, we need 6400 units of flour and 6500 units of
      sugar. </p>
	
      <p> This activity shows that the composition of matrix
      transformations corresponds to the product of matrices, 
      an important observation that we summarize in
      the following proposition. </p>

      <proposition>
	<statement>
	  <p> If we have a matrix transformation <m>T</m> defined by
	  the matrix <m>A</m> and a matrix transformation <m>S</m>
	  defined by the matrix <m>B</m>, then the composition of the
	  matrix transformations is a new matrix transformation
	  <m>S\circ T</m> defined by the matrix <m>BA</m>.

      </activity>

      <p> This is type of situation occurs frequently.  We have
      a vector <m>\xvec</m> that describes the state of some system;
      in this case, <m>\xvec</m> describes the distribution of trucks
      between the two locations at a particular time.  Then we have a
      matrix <m>A</m> that  
      defines a matrix transformation with <m>T(\xvec) =
      A\xvec</m> describing the state at some later time.  We 
      call <m>\xvec</m> the <em>state</em> vector and
      <m>T</m> the <em>transition</em> function, as it describes the
      transition of the state vector from one time to the next.
      <idx> state vector </idx>
      <idx> transition function </idx>
      </p>

      <p> We begin in an initial state <m>\xvec_0=
      \ctwovec{0}{1000}</m>.  The state one day later will be the
      vector <m>\xvec_1 = T(\xvec_0) = A\xvec_0</m>.  In the example
      from our activity, we have
      <me>
	A = \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	0.7 \amp 0.5 \\
	0.3 \amp 0.5 \\
	\end{array}\right]
      </me>.
      Therefore,
      <me>
	\xvec_1 = A\xvec_0 = 
	\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	0.7 \amp 0.5 \\
	0.3 \amp 0.5 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	\ctwovec{0}{1000}
	=\ctwovec{500}{500}\text{.}
      </me>
      </p>

      <p> We can, of course, repeat this process.  The vector
      <m>\xvec_1</m> describes the state after one day.  After a
      second day, we have the state vector
      <me>\xvec_2 = T(\xvec_1) = A\xvec_1 = A^2\xvec_0 =
      \ctwovec{600}{400}\text{.}
      </me>
      We can continue this process finding <m>\xvec_k</m>, the state
      after <m>k</m> days using <m>\xvec_k = A\xvec_{k-1} =
      A^k\xvec_0</m>.  In this way, we see that the long-term behavior
      of the state vector is determined by the powers of the matrix
      <m>A</m>.  </p>

      <p> Using Sage, we can compute <m>A^k</m> for some very large
      powers of <m>A</m>.  For instance,
      <me>
	A^{100} \approx \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	0.625 \amp 0.625 \\
	0.375 \amp 0.375 \\
	\end{array}\right]\text{.}
      </me>
      In fact, all large powers of <m>A</m> look very close to this
      matrix.  Therefore, after a very long time, the state vector is
      very close to
      <me>
	\left[\begin{array}{rr}
	0.625 \amp 0.625 \\
	0.375 \amp 0.375 \\
	\end{array}\right]
	\ctwovec{0}{1000}
	= \ctwovec{625}{375}\text{.}
      </me>
      This means that, eventually, 625 cars are at location <m>P</m>
      every day and 375 are at <m>Q</m>.</p>

      <p>
	<idx> discrete dynamical system </idx> We call this sitution
	in which the state of a system evolves from one time to the
	next according to the rule <m>\xvec_{k+1}=A\xvec_k</m> a
	<em>discrete dynamical system</em>.  In <xref ref="chap4" />,
	we will develop a theory that enables us to easily make
	long-term predictions without needing to compute
	large powers of the matrix. </p>

      Summary
    </title>

    <p>This section introduced matrix transformations, 
    functions that are defined by matrix-vector multiplication, such
    as <m>T(\xvec) = A\xvec</m> for some matrix <m>A</m>.

    <ul>
      <li><p> If <m>A</m> is an <m>m\times n</m> matrix, then
      <m>T:\real^n\to\real^m</m>. </p></li>

      <li><p> The columns of the matrix <m>A</m> are given by
      evaluating the transformation <m>T</m> on the vectors
      <m>\evec_j</m>;  that is,
      <me>
	A=\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	T(\evec_1) \amp T(\evec_2) \amp \ldots \amp T(\evec_n)
	\end{array}\right]
      </me>. </p></li>

      <li><p> The composition of matrix transformations corresponds to 
      matrix multiplication.</p></li>

      <li><p> A discrete dynamical system consists of a state vector
      <m>\xvec</m> along with a transition function <m>T(\xvec) =
      A\xvec</m> that describes how the state vector evolves from one
      time to the next.  Powers of the matrix <m>A</m> determine the
      long-term behavior of the state vector. </p></li>
