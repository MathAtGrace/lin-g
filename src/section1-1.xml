    What can we expect
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      At its heart, the subject of linear algebra is about linear
      equations and, more specifically, collections of linear
      equations.  Google routinely deals with a collection of
      trillions of equations each of which has trillions of unknowns.
      We will eventually understand how to deal with that kind of
      complexity.  To begin, however, we will look at a more familiar
      situation where we have a small number of equations and a small
      number of unknowns.  In spite of its relative simplicity, this
      situation is rich enough to demonstrate some fundamental
      concepts that we will motivate much of our exploration.

      The examples in this introductory activity demonstrate three
      possible outcomes, which are represented in the three figures
      below.
    </p>

    <figure xml:id = "fig-three-possibilities">
      <image source="images/three-possibilities" />
      <caption>
	Three possibilities for collections of linear equations
	in two unknowns.
      </caption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      In this example, we see that
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>With a single equation, there are infinitely many points
      <m>(x,y)</m> 
      satisfying that equation.</li>
      <li>Adding a second equation adds another condition we place
      on the points <m>(x,y)</m> resulting in a single point
      that satisfies both equations.</li>
      <li>Adding a third equation adds a third condition on the
      points <m>(x,y)</m>, and it is no longer possible to satisfy
      all three conditions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Generally speaking, a single equation will have many solutions,
      in fact, infinitely many.  As we add equations, we add
      conditions which lead to, in a sense we will make precise later,
      a smaller number of solutions.  Eventually, we have too many
      equations and find that no points satisfy all of them at the
      same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This example illustrates a general principle to which we will
      frequently return.  
    </p>

    <assemblage>
      <title> Solutions of linear equations </title>
      <p>
	Given a collection of linear equations, there are either:
	<ul>
	  <li> <p> infinitely many solutions,</p> </li>
	  <li> <p> exactly one solution, or</p> </li>
	  <li> <p> no solutions. </p></li>
	</ul>
      </p>
    </assemblage>

    <p>
      Notice that we can see a bit more.  In
      <xref ref="fig-three-possibilities" />, we are looking at equations
      in two unknowns.  Here we see that
      <ul>
	<li> <p> One equation gave us infinitely solutions.</p> </li>
	<li> <p> Two equations gave us exactly one solution. </p></li>
	<li> <p> Three equations gave us no solutions. </p></li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <sidebyside widths="50% 40%" margins="0%" valign="top">
      <p>
      It seems reasonable to wonder if the number of solutions depends
      on whether the number of equations is less than, equal to, or
      greater than the number of unknowns.  Of course, this cannot
      always be the case;  remember that one of our examples consisted of
      two equations that were graphically represented by parallel
      lines and that therefore had no solutions.  Still, it seems safe
      to think that the more equations we have, the smaller the set of
      solutions will be.
      </p>
      <image source="images/intro-parallel" />
    </sidebyside>
    
    <p>
      Let's also consider some examples of equations having three
      unknowns, which we call <m>x</m>, <m>y</m>, and <m>z</m>.  Just as
      solutions to linear equations in two unknowns formed straight
      lines, solutions to linear equations in three
      unknowns form planes.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we consider an equation in three unknowns graphically, we
      need to add a third coordinate axis, as shown in
      <xref ref="fig-coordinates" />.

    <p>
      As shown in <xref ref="fig-plane-z0" />,
      a linear equation in two unknowns, such as <m>y=0</m>, is a
      line while a linear equation in three unknowns, such as
      <m>z=0</m>, is a plane.

    <p>
      In three unknowns, the set of solutions to one linear
      equation forms a plane.  The set of solutions to a pair of
      linear equations is seen graphically as the
      intersection of the two planes.  As in <xref
      ref="fig-two-planes" />, we typically expect this intersection
      to be a line.

    </figure>

    <p>
      When we add a third equation, we are looking for the
      intersection of three planes, which we expect to form a point,
      as in the left of <xref ref="fig-three-planes" />.  However, in
      certain special cases, it may happen that there are no
      solutions, as seen on the right.

      <statement>
      <p> This activity begins with equations having three unknowns.
      In this case, we know that the solutions of a single equation

    <title>
      Systems of linear equations
    </title>

    <p>
      Now that we have seen some simple examples, let's clarify
      what we mean by a system of linear equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, we considered a linear equation having the form
      <me> y = 2x - 1</me>.  It will be convenient for us to rewrite
      this so that all the unknowns are on one side of the equation:
      <me> -2x + y = -1</me>.
      Thinking graphically, this gives us the flexibility to describe
      all lines;  for 
      instance, vertical lines, such as <m>x=3</m>, may be represented
      in this form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that each term on the left is the product of a constant
      and the first power of a unknown.  In the future, we will want
      to consider equations having many more unknowns, which we
      will sometimes
      denote as <m>x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n</m>.  This leads to the
      following definition:
    </p>

    <definition>
      <p>
	<idx> <h> linear equation </h></idx>
	A linear equation in the unknowns <m>x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n</m> may
	be written in the form
	<me>
	  a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_n = b
	  </me>, where <m>a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n</m> are real numbers known
	  as <em>coefficients</em>.
      </p>
    </definition>

    <p>
      By a <term>system of linear equations</term> or a
      <idx> <h> linear system</h></idx>
      <term>linear system</term>, we mean a
      collection of linear equations written in a common set of
      unknowns.  For example,
      <me>
	\begin{alignedat}{4}
	2x_1 \amp {} + \amp {} 1.2x_2 \amp {}-{} \amp 4x_3 \amp {}={}
	\amp 3.7 \\
	-0.1x_1 \amp {} \amp {}  \amp {}  + {} \amp x_3 \amp {}={}
	\amp 2 \\
	x_1 \amp {}+{} \amp x_2 \amp {}-{} \amp x_3 \amp {}={} \amp
	1.4. \\
	\end{alignedat}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      A <em> solution </em> to a linear system is simply 
      a set of numbers <m>x_1 = s_1, x_2 = s_2, \ldots, x_n=s_n</m>
      that satisfy all the equations in the system.
    </p>

    <p>
      For instance, we earlier considered the linear system
      <me>
	\begin{alignedat}{3}
	-x \amp {}+{} \amp y \amp {} = {} \amp 1 \\
	-2x \amp {}+{} \amp y \amp {} = {} \amp -1. \\
	\end{alignedat}
      </me>
      To check that <m>(x,y) = (2,3)</m> is a solution, we verify that the
      following equations are valid.
      <me>
	\begin{alignedat}{3}
	-2 \amp {}+{} \amp 3 \amp {} = {} \amp 1 \\
	-2(2) \amp {}+{} \amp 3 \amp {} = {} \amp -1. \\
	\end{alignedat}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      <idx> solution space </idx>
      We call the set of all solutions the <em> solution space </em>
      of the linear system.
    </p>

	      We have a solution when <m>x=3</m> and <m>z=-2</m>.
	      Therefore, <m>(x,y,z)=(3,0,-2)</m> is a solution to the
	      original system of equations.

	      <li><p> Since we have found two solutions to the system

      Summary
    </title>

    <p> The point of this section is to build some intuition about the
    behavior of solutions to linear systems through consideration of
    some simple examples.  We will develop a deeper and more precise
    understanding of these phenomena in our future explorations.
    </p>
    <p><ul>
      <li><p>
	A linear equation is one that may be written in the form
	<me>
	  a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \ldots + a_nx_n = b
	  </me>.
      </p></li>

      <li><p> A linear system is a collection of linear equations and
      a solution is a set of values assigned to each of the unknowns
      that make each equation true.
      </p></li>

      <li> <p>
	We came to expect that a linear system has either
	infinitely many solutions, exactly one solution, or no
	solutions.
      </p></li>

      <li> <p>
	When we add more equations to a system, the solution space
	usually seems to become smaller.
      </p></li>
    </ul></p>
