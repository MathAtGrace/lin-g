  <title> Linear algebra and computing </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> Underneath everything we have looked at so far, we have been
    concerned with 
    finding solutions to systems of linear equations.  Our principal
    tool for doing that has been Gaussian elimination, which we first
    met back in <xref ref="sec-finding-solutions" />.  When confronted
    with a linear system, we frequently find the reduced row echelon
    form of the system's augmented matrix to read off the
    solution. </p>

    <p> While this is a convenient approach to learning linear algebra,
    in the real world, people rarely find the reduced row echelon form
    of a matrix.  In this chapter, we will describe why this is the
    case and then explore some alternatives.  The intent here is to
    demonstrate how we perform linear algebraic computations in the
    real world.  In particular, we will improve our techniques for
    solving linear systems and for finding eigenvectors through
    Gaussian elimination. </p>
