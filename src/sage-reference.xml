    Sage Reference
  </title>

  <p>
    As we have introduced a number of Sage commands throughout the
    text, it could be helpful to have the most important ones summarized
    in a single place.  That is the aim of this appendix.
  </p>

  <p>
    <dl>
      <li><title> Accessing Sage </title>
      <p> In addition to the Sage cellls included throughout the book,
      there are a number of ways to access Sage. 
      <ol marker="a.">
	<li><p> There is a freely available Sage cell at  
	<url href="https://sagecell.sagemath.org/"
	     visual="sagecell.sagemath.org" />.
	</p></li>
	<li><p> You can save your Sage work by creating an account at
	<url href="https://cocalc.com"
	     visual="cocalc.com"/>
	and working in a Sage worksheet.
	</p></li>
	<li><p> There is a page of Sage cells at
	<url href="http://gvsu.edu/s/0Ng"
	     visual="gvsu.edu/s/0Ng"/>.
	The results obtained from
	evaluating one cell are available in other cells on that page.
	However, you will lose any work once
	the page is reloaded.  
      </p></li>
      </ol>
      </p></li>

      <li><title> Creating matrices </title>
      <p> There are a couple of ways to create matrices.  For
      instance, the matrix
      <me>
	\begin{bmatrix}
	-2 \amp 3 \amp 0 \amp 4 \\
	1 \amp -2 \amp 1 \amp -3 \\
	0 \amp 2 \amp 3 \amp 0 \\
	\end{bmatrix}
      </me>
      can be created in either of the two following ways.
	<ol marker="a.">
	  <li> <p>
	    <cd>
matrix(3, 4, [-2, 3, 0, 4,
               1,-2, 1,-3,
	       0, 2, 3, 0])
	    </cd>
	  </p>
	  </li>
	  <li> <p>
	    <cd>
matrix([ [-2, 3, 0, 4],
         [ 1,-2, 1,-3],
	 [ 0, 2, 3, 0] ])
	    </cd>
	  </p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </p>
      <p>
	Be aware that Sage can treat mathematically equivalent
	matrices in different ways depending on how they are entered. 
	For instance, the matrix
	<cd>
matrix([ [1, 2],
         [2, 1] ])
	</cd>
	has integer entries while
	<cd>
matrix([ [1.0, 2.0],
         [2.0, 1.0] ])
	</cd>
	has floating point entries.
      </p>

      <p>
	If you would like the entries to be considered as floating
	point numbers, you can include <c>RDF</c> in the definition
	of the matrix.
	<cd>
matrix(RDF, [ [1, 2],
              [2, 1] ])
	</cd>
      </p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<title>Reduced row echelon form</title>
	<p>
	  The reduced row echelon form of a matrix can be obtained
	  using the <c>rref()</c> function.  For instance,
	  <cd>
A = matrix([ [1,2], [2,1] ])
A.rref()
	  </cd>
	</p>
      </li>
    </dl>
  </p>
