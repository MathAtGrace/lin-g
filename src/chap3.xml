  <title>Invertibility, bases, and coordinate systems</title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      In <xref ref="chap2" />, we examined our two fundamental
      questions, <xref ref="fundamental-questions" />, concerning the
      existence and uniqueness of solutions to linear systems
      independently of one another.  We found that every equation of
      the form <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> has a solution when the columns
      of <m>A</m> span <m>\real^m</m>.  We also found that any
      solution of the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is unique when
      the columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent.  In this
      chapter, we explore the situation in which these two conditions
      hold simultaneously.
