  <title> Least squares problems  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> A linear system with more equations than unknowns usually has
    no solutions.  Suppose, for example, that the equation
    <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> is formed from an <m>m\times n</m> matrix
    <m>A</m> having more rows than columns.  Because not every row can
    have a pivot position, the columns of <m>A</m> will not span
    <m>\real^m</m>.  This means that for most vectors <m>\bvec</m>,
    the equation <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> will be inconsistent.
    </p>

    <p> Our story needn't end there, however.  When the equation
    <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> is inconsistent, we may instead seek the
    vector <m>\xvec</m> where <m>A\xvec</m> is as close as possible to
    <m>\bvec</m>.  Using the ideas we have constructed in this
    chapter, we will see that orthogonal projections give us just the
    right tool for doing this.

  <subsection>
    <title> A first example </title>

    <p> We begin with an example that demonstrates a least
    squares problem and how we can approach it.
    </p>

    <activity>
      <p> Suppose we have three data points <m>(1,1)</m>,
      <m>(2,1)</m>, and <m>(3,3)</m> and that we would like to find a
      line passing through them.
      <ol label="a.">
	<li><p> Plot these three points in <xref ref="fig-ls-empty"
	/>.  Are you able to draw a line that passes through these three
	points? 
	<figure xml:id="fig-ls-empty">
	  <sidebyside width="50%">
	    <image source = "images/empty-ls" />
	  </sidebyside>
	  <caption> Plot the three data points here. </caption>
	</figure>
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Let's try to find a line that passes through these
	points.  Remember that the equation of a line can be written
	as <m>y=b + mx</m> where <m>m</m> is the slope and <m>b</m> is
	the <m>y</m>-intercept.  We will try to find <m>m</m> and
	<m>b</m> so that the three points lie on the line.  </p>

	<p> The first data point <m>(1,1)</m> will give us an equation
	for <m>m</m> and <m>b</m>.  In particular, we know that when
	<m>x=1</m>, then <m>y=1</m> so we have
	<m>b + m(1) = 1</m> or <m>b + m = 1</m>.  Use the other two
	data points to create a linear system describing <m>m</m> and
	<m>b</m>.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Is there a solution to this linear system?  How does
	this relate to your attempt to draw a line through the three
	points above?
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Identify <m>A</m> and <m>\bvec</m> so that the linear
	system has the form <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m>.  Since this system is
	inconsistent, we know that <m>\bvec</m> is not in the column
	space <m>\col(A)</m>.  Consequently, we form <m>\widehat\bvec</m>,
	the orthogonal projection of <m>\bvec</m> onto <m>\col(A)</m>,
	which is the vector in <m>\col(A)</m> closest to
	<m>\bvec</m>.  Find an orthogonal basis for
	<m>\col(A)</m> and use it to find the orthogonal projection
	<m>\widehat\bvec</m> of <m>\bvec</m> onto <m>\col(A)</m>.
	</p></li>

	<li><p> Since <m>\widehat\bvec</m> is in <m>\col(A)</m>, the
	equation <m>A\xvec = \widehat\bvec</m> is consistent.  Find its
	solution <m>\xvec = \twovec{b}{m}</m> and sketch the line
	<m>y=b + mx</m> in <xref ref="fig-ls-empty" />.  We say that
	this is the line of best fit.
	</p></li>
      </ol>
      </p>
    </activity>

    <p> The example appearing in this activity illustrates the
    idea behind least squares problems.  When presented with a linear
    system that has no solution, we trade it in for a new linear
    system that we can solve.  More specifically, if
    <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> has no solution, we instead find
    the vector <m>\xvec</m> that minimizes the distance between
    <m>A\xvec</m> and <m>\bvec</m>.
    </p>

    <p> In the example above, we call the data points
    <m>(x_i, y_i)</m> and construct the matrix <m>A</m> and
    vector <m>\bvec</m> as
    <me>
      A =
      \begin{bmatrix}
      1 \amp x_1 \\
      1 \amp x_2 \\
      1 \amp x_3 \\
      \end{bmatrix},\hspace{24pt}
      \bvec = \threevec{y_1}{y_2}{y_3}\text{.}
    </me>
    If we represent a line using the vector <m>\xvec = \twovec bm</m>,
    the equation <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> seeks a line that passes through
    all the data points.  In our example, it is clear that there
    is no such line, a fact reflected by the inconsistency of the
    equation <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m>.
    </p>

    <p> Instead, we seek <m>\xvec</m> so that <m>A\xvec =
    \threevec{b+mx_1}{b+mx_2}{b+mx_3}</m> is as close to <m>\bvec</m>
    as possible.  We therefore look at the 
    square of the distance between <m> A\xvec</m> and <m>\bvec</m>:
    <me>
      \begin{aligned}
      \len{\bvec - A\xvec}^2 \amp =  \\
      \amp \left(y_1-(b+mx_1)\right)^2 + 
      \left(y_2-(b+mx_2)\right)^2 +
      \left(y_3-(b+mx_3)\right)^2\text{,} \\
      \end{aligned}
    </me>
    and ask to find the values for <m>b</m> and <m>m</m> that
    make this sum of squares as small as possible.  This is why we
    call this a <em>least squares</em> problem.
    </p>

    <p> The expression for <m>\len{b-A\xvec}^2</m> has geometric
    meaning within the context of the problem.  If we draw the line
    corresponding to the vector <m>\xvec=\twovec bm</m>, we may
    measure by how much the line misses the data points.  For instance
    <m>y_i - (b + mx_i)</m> is the vertical distance between the line
    and the data point <m>(x_i, y_i)</m>, as shown in <xref
    ref="fig-least-squares-def" />.  Seen in this way, the square of
    the distance <m>\len{\bvec-A\xvec}^2</m> measures how much the
    line defined by the vector <m>\xvec</m> misses the data points.
    The solution to the least squares problem is the line that misses
    the data points by the least.

  <subsection>
    <title> Solving least squares problems </title>
    
    <p> Now that we've seen an example of what we're trying to
    accomplish, let's put this technique into a more general
    framework.
    </p>

    <p> Given an inconsistent system <m>A\xvec =
    \bvec</m>, we seek to find <m>\xvec</m> that minimizes the
    distance from <m>A\xvec</m> to <m>\bvec</m>.  We find <m>\xvec</m>
    by forming <m>\widehat\bvec</m>, the orthogonal projection of
    <m>\bvec</m> onto the column space <m>\col(A)</m> and then solving
    <m>A\xvec = \widehat\bvec</m>.
    </p>

    <p> Before going further, let's take note of what a solution means
    in this context.  For instance, we know that there is no solution
    to the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m>.  We therefore modify the
    vector on the right-hand side to <m>\bhat</m>, the orthogonal
    projection of <m>\bvec</m> onto <m>\col(A)</m>.  As we move
    forward, we will denote the solution of <m>A\xvec = \bhat</m> by
    <m>\xhat</m> and call this vector the <em>least squares
    approximate solution</em> of <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> to distinguish it
    from a (non-existent) solution of <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m>.
    </p>

    <p> Let's now remember how orthogonal projection works:  the
    orthogonal projection <m>\widehat\bvec</m> of <m>\bvec</m> onto
    the column space <m>\col(A)</m> is defined so that
    <m>\widehat\bvec - \bvec</m> is orthogonal to <m>\col(A)</m>.  In
    other words, <m>\bhat-\bvec</m> is in the orthogonal complement
    <m>\col(A)^\perp</m>.  Remember also that <m>\col(A)^\perp =
    \nul(A^T)</m>, which implies that
    <me>
      A^T(\widehat\bvec-\bvec) = \zerovec\text{.}
    </me>
    Finally, the least squares approximate solution is the vector
    <m>\xhat</m> such that <m>A\xhat = \widehat\bvec</m>, which gives
    <me>
      \begin{aligned}
      A^T(A\xhat - \bvec) \amp = \zerovec \\
      A^TA\xhat - A^T\bvec \amp = \zerovec \\
      A^TA\xhat \amp = A^T\bvec\text{.}
      \end{aligned}
    </me>
    This is an important equation so we will take note of it here.
    </p>

    <proposition>
      <statement>
	<idx> normal equations </idx>
	<p>
	The least squares approximation solution <m>\widehat\xvec</m>
	to the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is given by the <em>normal
	equations</em>
	<me>A^TA\widehat\xvec = A^T\bvec\text{.}
	</me>
	</p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p> The normal equations will always be consistent.  This is
    because <m>\bhat</m>, the orthogonal projection of <m>\bvec</m>
    onto <m>\col(A)</m>, is a vector in <m>\col(A)</m>.  This means
    that <m>A\xhat=\bhat</m> will always have a solution.
    </p>

    <p> Moreover, if the columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent,
    there is exactly one solution to the normal equations.  To see
    why, let's imagine, for the moment, that <m>\xvec</m> is a
    solution to the homogeneous equation
    <m>A^TA\xvec = \zerovec</m>.  Then we have
    <me>
      \begin{aligned}
      \xvec\cdot(A^TA\xvec) \amp = \xvec\cdot\zerovec = 0 \\
      \xvec^TA^TA\xvec \amp = 0 \\
      (A\xvec)^T(A\xvec) \amp = 0 \\
      (A\xvec)\cdot(A\xvec) \amp = 0 \\
      \len{A\xvec}^2 \amp = 0 \\
      A\xvec \amp = \zerovec \text{.} \\
      \end{aligned}
    </me>
    In other words, if <m>\xvec</m> is a solution to the homogeneous
    equation <m>A^TA\xvec = \zerovec</m>, then we know that <m>A\xvec
    = \zerovec</m>.  Since we are assuming that the columns of
    <m>A</m> are linearly independent, we know that the homogeneous
    equation <m>A\xvec=\zerovec</m> has only the trivial solution
    <m>\xvec = \zerovec</m>.  Therefore, the homogeneous equation
    <m>A^TA\xvec=\zerovec</m> has only the trivial solution, which
    means that <m>A^TA</m> has a pivot position in every column.
    Hence, the normal equations <m>A^TA\xhat = A^T\bvec</m> must
    have a unique solution.
    </p>

    <proposition>
      <statement>
	<p> If the columns of <m>A</m> are linearly independent, then
	there is a unique least squares approximate solution
	<m>\xhat</m> to the equation <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> given by the
	normal equations
	<me>
	  A^TA\xhat = A^T\bvec\text{.}
	</me>
	</p>
      </statement>
    </proposition>

    <p> Let's put this proposition to use in the next activity.

  <subsection>
    <title> Using <m>QR</m> factorizations </title>

    <p> We have seen how to find the least squares approximate
    solution <m>\xhat</m> to <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> by solving the normal
    equations <m>A^TA\xhat = A^T\bvec</m>.  As stated in this form,
    solving the normal equations involves row reducing the matrix
    <m>A^TA</m>, and this could be computationally intensive when
    there are a lot of parameters in the linear function we are
    fitting to the data.  If we have a <m>QR</m> factorization of
    <m>A</m>, however, there is an easier way to find the least
    squares approximate solution <m>\xhat</m> as we will now see.
    </p>

    <p> Suppose we have <m>A=QR</m>, and we would like to find the
    least squares approximate solution <m>\xhat</m> of
    <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m>.  Our first step is to project <m>\bvec</m>
    orthogonally onto <m>\col(A)</m> to obtain <m>QQ^T\bvec</m>.  The
    least square approximate solution is then
    <me>
      \begin{aligned}
      A\xhat \amp = QQ^T\bvec\\
      QR\xhat \amp = QQ^T\bvec\text{.}
      \end{aligned}
    </me>
    If we multiply both sides of this expression by <m>Q^T</m> and
    remember that <m>Q^TQ=I</m>, the identity matrix, we
    have
    <me>
      \begin{aligned}
      Q^TQR\xhat \amp = Q^TQQ^T\bvec \\
      IR\xhat \amp = IQ^T\bvec \\
      R\xhat \amp = Q^T\bvec\text{.}
      \end{aligned}
    </me>
    This is convenient because, as we recall, <m>R</m> is an upper
    triangular matrix so that the equation <m>R\xhat = Q^T\bvec</m>
    can be efficiently solved using back substitution.
    </p>

    <proposition>
      <statement>
	<p> Given the <m>QR</m> factorization, <m>A=QR</m>, the least
	squares approximate solution <m>\xhat</m> to the equation

	  R\xhat = Q^T\bvec\text{.}

    <p> Let's put this proposition to use in the next activity.

    <activity>
      <p> Brozak’s formula, which is used to calculate a person's body fat
      index (<m>BFI</m>), is
      <me>BFI = 100 \left(\frac{4.57}{\rho} - 4.142\right)
      </me>
      where <m>\rho</m> denotes a person's body density in grams per
      cubic centimeter.  Obtaining an accurate measure of <m>\rho</m>
      is difficult, however, because it requires submerging the person
      in water and measuring the volume of water displaced.  Instead,
      we will gather several other body measurements, which are more
      easily obtained, and use it to
      predict <m>BFI</m>.  For instance, we take 10 patients and
      measure their weight <m>w</m> in pounds, height <m>h</m> in
