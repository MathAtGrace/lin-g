    <statement>
      <p> For each of the augmented matrices in reduced row echelon
      form given below, determine whether the corresponding linear
      system is consistent and, if it is, determine whether the
      solution is unique.  If the system is consistent, identify the
      free variables and the basic variables and give a description of
      the solution space in parametric form.

    <statement>
      <p> In a previous math class, you have probably seen the fact
      that, if we are given two points in the plane, then there is a
      unique line passing through both of them.  In this problem, we
      will begin with the four points on the left below and ask to
      find a polynomial that passes through these four points as shown
      on the right.

      <p> A degree three polynomial can be written as
      <me>
	p(x) = a + bx + cx^2 + dx^3
      </me>
      where <m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m> are
      coefficients that we would like to determine.
      Since we want the polynomial to pass through the point
      <m>(3,1)</m>, we should require that
      <me>
	p(3) = a + 3b + 9c + 27d = 1
	</me>.
	In this way, we obtain a linear equation for the coefficients
	<m>a</m>, <m>b</m>, <m>c</m>, and <m>d</m>.
	<ol>
	  <li> <p> Write the four linear equations for the
	  coefficients obtained by requiring that the graph of the
	  polynomial <m>p(x)</m> passes through the four
	  points above. </p></li>

	  system of equations and use the Sage cell below to solve for

	  <li> <p> Write the polynomial <m>p(x)</m> that you found and

	    Rather than looking for a degree three polynomial, suppose
