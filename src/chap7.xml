  <title>
    The Spectral Theorem and singular value decompositions
  </title> 

  <introduction>
    <p>
      <xref ref="chap4" /> demonstrated several important uses for the
      theory of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  For example,
      knowing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix <m>A</m>
      enabled us to make predictions about the long-term behavior of
      dynamical systems in which some initial state <m>\xvec_0</m>
      evolves according to the rule <m>\xvec_{k+1} = A\xvec_k</m>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The range of problems we can study using eigenvectors, however,
      is somewhat limited.  First, eigenvectors only exist when the
      matrix <m>A</m> is square, and we have seen situations, such as
      the least squares problems in <xref ref="sec-least-squares" />,
      where the matrices we're interested in are not square.  Second,
      even when <m>A</m> is square, there may not be a basis for
      <m>\real^n</m> consisting of eigenvectors of <m>A</m>, 
      an important condition we required for some of our work.
    </p>

      This chapter introduces singular value decompositions, which may
      be viewed as a generalization of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
      In fact, we will see that every matrix, whether square or not,
      has a singular value decomposition and that knowing it gives us
      a great deal of insight into the matrix.  It's been said that
      having a singular value decomposition is like looking at a
      matrix with X-ray vision, as the decomposition can reveal the
      essential features of the matrix.
