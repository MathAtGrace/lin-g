  <title>
    Vectors and linear combinations
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      It is a remarkable fact that algebra, which is about equations
      and their solutions, and geometry are intimately connected.  For
      instance, the solution set of a linear equation in two unknowns,
      such as <m> 2x + y = 1</m>, can be represented graphically as a
      straight line.  The aim of this section is to further this
      connection by introducing vectors, which will help us to apply
      geometric intuition to our thinking about linear systems.
    </p>
    
  </introduction>

  <subsection>
    <title>
      Vectors
    </title>

    <p>
      <idx> vector </idx>
      A <em> vector </em> is most simply thought of as a matrix with a
      single column.  For instance,
      <me>
	\vvec = \left[
	\begin{array}{r}
	2 \\
	1 \\
	\end{array}
	\right],
	\wvec = \left[
	\begin{array}{r}
	-3 \\
	1 \\
	0 \\
	2 \\
	\end{array}
	\right]
      </me>
      are both vectors.  Since the vector <m>\vvec</m> has two
      entries, we say that it is a two-dimensional vector;  in the
      same way, the vector <m>\wvec</m> is a four-dimensional
      vector.  We denote the set of all <m>m</m>-dimensional vectors
      by <m>\real^m</m>.  Consequently, if <m>\uvec</m> is a
      3-dimensional vector, we say that <m>\uvec</m> is in
      <m>\real^3</m>. 
    </p>

    <p>
      While it can be difficult to visualize a four-dimensional
      vector, we can draw a simple picture describing the
      two-dimensional vector <m>\vvec</m>.
      <sidebyside width="50%">
	<image source="images/vector-u" />
      </sidebyside>
    </p>

    <p>
      We think of <m>\vvec</m> as describing a walk we take in the
      plane where we move two units horizontally and one unit
      vertically.  Though we allow ourselves to begin walking from any
      point in the plane, we will most frequently begin at the
      origin, in which case we arrive at the the point
      <m>(2,1)</m>, as shown in the figure.  
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two simple algebraic operations we can perform on
      vectors.
      <dl>
	<li><title> Scalar Multiplication </title>
	<idx> scalar multiplication </idx>
	<p>
	  We multiply a vector <m>\vvec</m> by a real number <m>a</m> by
	  multiplying each of the components of <m>\vvec</m> by
	  <m>a</m>.  For instance,
	  <me>
	    -3\left[\begin{array}{r} 2 \\ -4 \\ 1 \\ \end{array}\right]
	    = \left[\begin{array}{r} -6 \\ 12 \\ -3 \\
	    \end{array}\right].
	  </me>
	  The real number <m>a</m> is called a <em>scalar</em>.
	</p>
	</li>

	<li><title> Vector Addition </title>
	<idx> vector addition </idx>
	<p>
	  We add two vectors of the same dimension by adding their
	  components.  For instance,
	  <me>
	    \left[\begin{array}{r} 2 \\ -4 \\ 3 \\ \end{array}\right]
	    +
	    \left[\begin{array}{r} -5 \\ 6 \\ -3 \\ \end{array}\right]
	    = 
	    \left[\begin{array}{r} -3 \\ 2 \\ 0 \\ \end{array}\right].
	  </me>
	</p>

      <solution>
	<p> 
	  Solutions to this preview activity are given in the text
	  below.
	</p>
      </solution>
    </exploration>

    <p>
      The preview activity demonstrates how we may interpret 
      scalar multiplication and vector addition geometrically.
    </p>

    <p>
      First, we see that scalar multiplication has the effect of
      stretching or compressing a vector.  Multiplying by a negative
      scalar changes the direction of the vector.  In either case, we
      see that scalar multiplying the vector <m>\vvec</m> produces
      a new vector on the line defined by <m>\vvec</m>, as shown in
      <xref ref="fig-scalar-mult" />.
      <figure xml:id="fig-scalar-mult">
	<sidebyside width="50%">
	  <image source="images/scalar-mult" />
	</sidebyside>
	<caption> Scalar multiples of the vector <m>\vvec</m>.
	</caption>
      </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
      To understand the sum <m>\vvec + \wvec</m>, we 
      imagine walking from the origin with the appropriate horizontal
      and vertical changes given by <m>\vvec</m>.  From there, we
      continue our walk using the horizontal and vertical changes
      prescribed by 
      <m>\wvec</m>, after which we arrive at the sum <m>\vvec
      + \wvec</m>.  This is illustrated on the left of
      <xref ref="fig-vector-sum" /> where the
      tail of <m>\wvec</m> is placed on the tip of <m>\vvec</m>.
      <figure xml:id="fig-vector-sum">
	<sidebyside widths="45% 45%">
	  <image source="images/vector-addition-a" />
	  <image source="images/vector-addition" />
	</sidebyside>
	<caption> Vector addition as a simple walk in the plane is
	illustrated on the left.  The vector sum represented as the
	diagonal of a parallelogram is on the right.
	</caption>
      </figure>
      Alternatively, we may construct the parallelogram with
      <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> as two sides.  The sum
      is then the diagonal of the parallelogram, as illustrated on the
      right of <xref ref="fig-vector-sum" />.
    </p>

    <p>
      We have now seen that the set of vectors having the form
      <m>a\vvec</m> is a line.  To form the set of vectors
      <m>a\vvec+\wvec</m>, we can begin with the vector <m>\wvec</m>
      and add multiples of <m>\vvec</m>.  Geometrically, this means
      that we begin from the tip of <m>\wvec</m> and move in a
      direction parallel to <m>\vvec</m>.  The effect is to translate
      the line <m> a\vvec</m> by the vector <m>\wvec</m>, as shown in
      <xref ref="fig-parametric-line" />.
      <figure xml:id="fig-parametric-line">
	<sidebyside width="50%">
	  <image source = "images/line-param" />
	</sidebyside>
	<caption> The set of vectors <m>a\vvec + \wvec</m> form a
	line.
	</caption>
      </figure>
    </p>

    <p>
      At times, it will be useful for us to think of vectors and
      points interchangeably.  That is, we may wish to think of the
      vector <m>\left[\begin{array}{r} 2 \\ 1 \end{array}\right]</m>
      as describing the point <m>(2,1)</m> and vice-versa.  When we
      say that the vectors having the form <m>a\vvec + \wvec</m>
      form a line, we really mean that the tips of the vectors
      all lie on the line passing through <m>\wvec</m> and
      parallel to <m>\vvec</m>.
    </p>

    <observation>
      <p> Even though these vector operations are new, it is
      straightforward to check that some familiar 
      properties hold.
      <dl>
	<li> <title> Commutativity </title>
	<p> <m>\vvec + \wvec = \wvec + \vvec</m>. </p></li>
	<li> <title> Distributivity </title>
	<p> <m>a(\vvec + \wvec) = a\vvec + a\wvec</m>. </p></li>
      </dl>
      </p>
    </observation>

    <p>
      Sage can perform scalar multiplication and vector addition.  We
      define a vector using the <c>vector</c> command;  then <c>*</c>
      and <c>+</c> denote scalar multiplication and vector addition.
      <sage>
	<input>
	  v = vector([3,1])
	  w = vector([-1,2])
	  print (2*v)
	  print (v + w)

    <title> Linear combinations </title>

    <p> Linear combinations, which we encountered in the preview
    activity, provide the link between vectors and linear systems.  In
    particular, they will help us apply geometric intuition to
    problems involving linear systems.

    </activity>

    <p> This activity illustrates how linear combinations are
    constructed geometrically: the linear combination <m>a\vvec +
    b\wvec</m> is found by walking along <m>\vvec</m> a total of
    <m>a</m> times followed by walking along <m>\wvec</m> a total of
    <m>b</m> times.  When one of the weights is held constant while
    the other varies, the vector moves along a line.
    </p>

    <example>
    <p>
      The previous activity also shows that questions about linear
      combinations lead naturally to linear systems.  Let's ask how we
      can describe the vector <m>\bvec=\left[\begin{array}{r} -1 \\ 4
      \end{array} \right]</m> as a linear combination of <m>\vvec</m>
      and <m>\wvec</m>.  We need to find weights <m>a</m> and <m>b</m>
      such that
      <me>
	\begin{aligned}
	a\left[\begin{array}{r}2\\1\end{array}\right]
	+
	b\left[\begin{array}{r}1\\2\end{array}\right]
	\amp =
	\left[\begin{array}{r}-1\\4\end{array}\right]  \\ \\
	\left[\begin{array}{r}2a\\a\end{array}\right]
	+
	\left[\begin{array}{r}b\\2b\end{array}\right]
	\amp =
	\left[\begin{array}{r}-1\\4\end{array}\right]  \\ \\
	\left[\begin{array}{r}2a+b\\a+2b\end{array}\right]
	\amp =
	\left[\begin{array}{r}-1\\4\end{array}\right]  \\
	\end{aligned}
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Equating the components of the vectors on each side of the
      equation, we arrive at the linear system
      <me>
	\begin{alignedat}{3}
	2a \amp {}+{} \amp b \amp {}={} \amp -1 \\
	a \amp {}+{} \amp 2b \amp {}={} \amp 4 \\
	\end{alignedat}
      </me>
      This means that <m>\bvec</m> is a linear combination of
      <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> if this linear system is
      consistent. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To solve this linear system, we construct its corresponding
      augmented matrix and find its reduced row echelon form.
      <me>
	\left[
	\begin{array}{rr|r}
	2 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
	1 \amp 2 \amp 4

      which tells us the weights <m>a=-2</m> and <m>b=3</m>;  that is,
      <me>
	-2\vvec + 3 \wvec = \bvec
      </me>.
      In fact, we know even more because the reduced row echelon matrix
      tells us that these are the only possible weights.  Therefore,
      <m>\bvec</m> may be expressed as a linear combination of
      <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> in exactly one way.
    </p>
    </example>

    <p>
      This example demonstrates the connection between linear
      combinations and linear systems.  Asking if a vector
      <m>\bvec</m> is a linear combination of vectors
      <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> is the same as asking
      whether an associated linear system is consistent.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, we may easily describe the linear system we obtain in
      terms of the vectors <m>\vvec</m>, <m>\wvec</m>, and
      <m>\bvec</m>. 
      Notice that the augmented matrix we found was
      <m>
	\left[
	\begin{array}{rr|r}
	2 \amp 1 \amp -1 \\
	1 \amp 2 \amp 4
	\end{array}
	\right].
      </m>
      The first two columns of this matrix are <m>\vvec</m> and
      <m>\wvec</m> and the rightmost column is <m>\bvec</m>.  As
      shorthand, we will write this augmented matrix replacing the
      columns with their vector representation:
      <me>
	\left[
	\begin{array}{rr|r}
	\vvec \amp \wvec \amp \bvec
	\end{array}
	\right]
      </me>.
      This fact is generally true so we record it in the following
      proposition.
    </p>

    <proposition xml:id="prop-system-comb">
      <statement>
	<p>
	  The vector <m>\bvec</m> is a linear combination of the vectors
	  <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> if and only if the linear
	  system corresponding to the augmented matrix
	  <me>
	    \left[
	    \begin{array}{rrrr|r}
	    \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \ldots \amp \vvec_n \amp 
	    \bvec
	    \end{array}
	    \right]
	  </me>
	  is consistent.  A solution to this linear system gives
	  weights <m>c_1,c_2,\ldots,c_n</m> such that
	  <me>
	    c_1\vvec_1 + c_2\vvec_2 + \ldots + c_n\vvec_n = \bvec
	  </me>.
	</p>
      </statement>
