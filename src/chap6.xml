  <title> Orthogonality </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      We introduced vectors as a means to develop visual intuition
      about our basic questions concerning linear systems.  For
      example, vectors allow us to reinterpret questions about the
      existence of solutions to linear systems as questions about the
      span of a set of vectors.  Questions about the uniqueness of
      solutions led to the concept of linear dependence and
      independence of vectors.

    <p>
      In this chapter, we expand this intuition by introducing an
      algebraic operation, known as the dot product, that enables us
      to think of vectors as geometric objects that have length and
      that form angles.  As we will see, this geometric tool will help
      us simplify the search for solutions to linear systems.  In
      addition, it will provide a important technique, known as least
      squares, for finding the best approximate solution when a linear
      system has no solution.
