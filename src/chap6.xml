  <title> Orthogonality </title>

  <introduction>
    <p> We introduced vectors as a way to develop visual intuition
    about basic questions concerning linear systems.  In this way, we
    reinterpreted questions about the existence of solutions to a
    linear system as questions about the span of a set of vectors.
    Questions about the uniqueness of solutions led to questions about
    the linear dependence of a set of vectors.
    </p>

    <p> In this chapter, we will expand this intuition by introducing
    an algebraic operation, known as the dot product, that helps us
    think of vectors as geometric objects that have length and that form
    angles.  As we will see, this tool will help us simplify the
    search for solutions to many linear systems.  In addition, it will
    provide a powerful tool, known as least squares, to find the best
    approximate solution when a linear system has no solution.
