  <title>
    The span of a set of vectors
  </title>

  <introduction>
    <p>
      Our work in this chapter enables us to rewrite a linear system
      in the form <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m>.  Besides being a more compact
      way of expressing a linear system, this form allows us to think
      about linear systems geometrically since matrix multiplication
      is defined in terms of linear combinations of vectors.
    </p>

    <p>
      We now return, in this and the next section, to the two
      fundamental questions asked in <xref ref="fundamental-questions"
      />.
      <ul>
	<li><p> <em>Existence:</em> Is there a solution to the
	equation <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m>?
	</p> </li>

	<li><p> <em> Uniqueness:</em> If there is a solution to the
	equation <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m>, is it unique? </p></li>

      </ul>
      In this section, we focus on the existence question and
      introduce the concept of <em>span</em> to provide a framework
      for thinking about it geometrically.
    </p>

	<li> <p> If the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is
	inconsistent, what can we say about the pivots of the

	<li> <p>
	  Consider the matrix <m>A</m>

	  <li><p>
	    We construct the augmented matrix

	      \left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}

	      0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0

	    </me>
	    which shows that the system is consistent.  The solution
	    space is described parametrically as
	    <me>
	      \xvec=\threevec{2}{3}{0}+x_3\threevec{2}{1}{1}\text{.}
	    </me>
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>
	    Now the augmented matrix is

	      -2 \amp 2 \amp 2 \amp 2 \\
	      1 \amp 1 \amp -3 \amp 6

	      0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1
	      \end{array}\right]
	    </me>
	    showing that the equation <m>A\xvec=\bvec</m> is
	    inconsistent.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>
	    There are two pivot positions in <m>A</m>, as shown.
	    <me>
	      \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	      {\mathbf 1} \amp 0 \amp -2 \\
	      -2 \amp {\mathbf 2} \amp 2 \\
	      1 \amp 1 \amp -3 \\
	      \end{array}\right]
	      \sim
	      \left[\begin{array}{rrr}

	      0 \amp {\mathbf 1} \amp -1 \\
	      0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	      \end{array}\right]\text{.}
	    </me>
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p>
	    Since there is a row of <m>A</m> that does not have a
	    pivot position, it is possible to augment <m>A</m> by a
	    vector <m>\bvec</m> so that we obtain a pivot position in
	    the rightmost column of the augmented matrix.  In this
	    case, we have an inconsistent system.

  <subsection>
    <title> The span of a set of vectors </title>

    <p>  In the preview activity, we considered a <m>3\times3</m>
    matrix <m>A</m> and found that the equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m>
    has a solution for some vectors <m>\bvec</m> in <m>\real^3</m> and
    has no solution for others.  We will introduce a concept called
    <em>span</em> that describes the vectors <m>\bvec</m> for which
    there is a solution.
    </p>

    <p>  Since we would like to think about this concept
    geometrically, we will consider an <m>m\times n</m> matrix
    <m>A</m> as being composed of <m>n</m> vectors in <m>\real^m</m>;
    that is,
    <me>
      A = \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
      \vvec_1\amp\vvec_2\amp\ldots\amp\vvec_n
      \end{array}\right]
    </me>.
    Remember that <xref ref="prop-matrix-eq-solution" /> says that the
    equation <m>A\xvec = \bvec</m> is consistent if and only if we can
    express 
    <m>\bvec</m> as a linear combination of
    <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m>.  
    </p>
    
    <definition>
      <idx> span </idx>
      <p> The span of a set of vectors
      <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> is the set of all linear
      combinations of the vectors.
      </p>
    </definition>

    <p>
      In other words, the span of
      <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> consists of all the
      vectors <m>\bvec</m> for which the equation
    <me>
      \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
      \vvec_1\amp\vvec_2\amp\ldots\amp\vvec_n
      \end{array}\right]
      \xvec = \bvec
    </me>
    is consistent.
    </p>

    <p>
      The span of a set of vectors has an appealing geometric
      interpretation.  Remember that we may think of a linear
      combination as a recipe for walking in <m>\real^m</m>.  We first
      move a prescribed amount in the direction of <m>\vvec_1</m>,
      then a prescribed amount in the direction of <m>\vvec_2</m>, and
      so on.  As the following activity will show, the span consists
      of all the places we can walk to.

	    <li><p>
	      No.  No matter how we change the weights, the linear

    <p>
      Let's consider the first example in the previous activity.
      Here, the vectors <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> are scalar
      multiples of one another, which means that they lie on the same
      line.  When we form linear combinations, we are allowed to walk
      only in the direction of <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m>, which
      means we are constrained to stay on this same line.  Therefore,
      the span of <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> consists only of this
      line.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <sidebyside width="50%">
	<image source="images/2d-span-line" />
      </sidebyside>
      <caption>
	<p> With this choice of vectors <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m>,
	all linear combinations lie on the line shown.  This line,
	therefore, is the span of the vectors <m>\vvec</m> and
	<m>\wvec</m>.
	</p>
      </caption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      We may see this algebraically since 
      the vector <m>\wvec = -2\vvec</m>.  Consequently,
      when we form a linear combination of <m>\vvec</m> and
      <m>\wvec</m>, we see that
      <me>
	\begin{aligned}
	a\vvec + b\wvec \amp {}={} a\vvec + b(-2\vvec) \\
	\amp {}={} (a-2b)\vvec \\
	\end{aligned}
      </me>.
      Therefore, any linear combination of <m>\vvec</m> and
      <m>\wvec</m> reduces to a scalar multiple of <m>\vvec</m>, and
      we have seen that the scalar multiples of a nonzero vector form
      a line.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the second example, however, the vectors are not scalar
      multiples of one another, and we see that we can construct
      any vector in <m>\real^2</m> as a linear combination of
      <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m>.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <sidebyside width="50%">
	<image source="images/2d-span-plane" />
      </sidebyside>
      <caption> <p> With this choice of vectors <m>\vvec</m> and
      <m>\wvec</m>, we are able to form any vector in <m>\real^2</m>
      as a linear combination.  Therefore, the span of the vectors
      <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> is the entire plane,
      <m>\real^2</m>. </p>
      </caption>
    </figure>

      <p>
	Once again, we can see this algebraically.  Asking if the
	vector <m>\bvec</m> is in the span of <m>\vvec</m> and
	<m>\wvec</m> is the same as asking if the linear system
	<me>
	  \begin{aligned}

	  \end{array}\right]

	  \left[\begin{array}{rr}

	  \xvec \amp {}={} \bvec \\

	</me>
	is consistent.
      </p>

      <p>
	The augmented matrix for this system is
	<me>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
	  2 \amp 1 \amp * \\
	  1 \amp 2 \amp * \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \sim
	  \left[\begin{array}{rr|r}
	  1 \amp 0 \amp * \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp * \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>.
	Since it is impossible to obtain a pivot in the rightmost
	column, we know that this system is consistent no matter what
	the vector <m>\bvec</m> is.  Therefore, every vector
	<m>\bvec</m> in <m>\real^2</m> is in the span of <m>\vvec</m>
	and <m>\wvec</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
	In this case, notice that the reduced row echelon form of the
	matrix 
	<me>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rr} \vvec \amp \wvec \end{array}\right] = 
	  \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  2 \amp 1 \\
	  1 \amp 2 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \sim
	  \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  1 \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>
	has a pivot in every row.  When this happens, it is not
	possible for any augmented matrix to have a pivot in the
	rightmost column.  Therefore, the linear system is
	consistent for every vector <m>\bvec</m>, which implies that
	the span of <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> is <m>\real^2</m>.
      </p>

      <convention>
	<p> We will denote the span of the set of vectors
	<m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> by
	<m>\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n}</m>.
	</p>
      </convention>

      <title> Pivot positions and span </title>

      <p>
	In the previous activity, we saw two examples, both of which
	considered two vectors <m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> in
	<m>\real^2</m>.  In one example, the 
	<m>\laspan{\vvec,\wvec}</m> consisted of a line;  in the other,
	the <m>\laspan{\vvec,\wvec}=\real^2</m>.  We would like to be
	able to distinguish these two situations in a more algebraic
	fashion.  After all, we will need to be able to deal
	with vectors in many more dimensions where we will not be able
	to draw pictures.
      </p>

      <p>
	The key is found by looking at the pivot
	positions of the matrix
	<m>\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	\vvec_1\amp\vvec_2\amp\ldots\vvec_n
	\end{array}\right]
	</m>.
	In the first example, the matrix whose columns are
	<m>\vvec</m> and <m>\wvec</m> is
	<me>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  1\amp -2 \\
	  2\amp -4 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \sim
	  \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  1\amp -2 \\
	  0\amp 0 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>,
	which has exactly one pivot position.  We found the
	<m>\laspan{\vvec,\wvec}</m> to be a line, in this case.
      </p>

      <p>
	In the second example, this matrix is
	<me>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  2\amp 1 \\
	  1\amp 2 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	  \sim
	  \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	  1\amp 0 \\
	  0\amp 1 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>,
	which has two pivot positions.  Here, we found
	<m>\laspan{\vvec,\wvec}=\real^2</m>.
      </p>

      <p>
	These examples point to the fact that the size of the span is
	related to the number of pivot positions.  We will develop
	this idea more fully in <xref ref="sec-linear-dep" />
	and <xref ref="sec-subspaces" />.  For now,
	however, we will examine the possibilities in
	<m>\real^3</m>.  
      </p>

      </activity>
	
      <p>
	This activity shows us the types of sets that can appear as
	the span of a set of vectors in <m>\real^3</m>.
	<ul>
	  <li><p>
	    First, with a
	    single vector, all linear combinations are simply scalar
	    multiples of that vector, which creates a line.
	    <sidebyside width="50%">
	      <image source="images/3d-line" />
	    </sidebyside>
	    Notice that the matrix formed by this vector has one
	    pivot, just as in our earlier example in <m>\real^2</m>. 
	    <me>
	      \threevec{1}{2}{1} \sim \threevec{1}{0}{0}
	    </me>.
	  </p> </li>

	  <li> <p>
	    When we consider linear combinations of the vectors
	    <me>
	      \evec_1 = \threevec{1}{0}{0},
	      \evec_2 = \threevec{0}{1}{0}
	    </me>,
	    we must obtain vectors of the form
	    <me>
	      a\evec_1 + b\evec_2 = a\threevec{1}{0}{0}+b\threevec{0}{1}{0}
	      = \threevec{a}{b}{0}
	    </me>.
	    Since the third component is zero, these vectors form the
	    plane <m>z=0</m>.
	    <sidebyside width="50%">
	      <image source="images/3d-plane-std" />
	    </sidebyside>
	    Notice here that the matrix composed of the vectors has
	    two pivot positions.
	    <me>
	      \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	      1 \amp 0 \\
	      0 \amp 1 \\
	      0 \amp 0 \\
	      \end{array}\right]
	    </me>.
	  </p> </li>

	  <li> <p> Similarly, the span of the vectors 
	  <me>
	    \vvec_1 = \threevec{1}{1}{-1},
	    \vvec_2 = \threevec{0}{2}{1}
	  </me>,
	  will form a plane.  
	  <sidebyside width="50%">
	    <image source="images/3d-plane-nonstd" />
	  </sidebyside>
	  We saw one vector <m>\bvec</m> that was not in
	  <m>\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2}</m> and one that is.
	  <sidebyside widths="45% 45%">
	    <image source="images/3d-plane-span-no" />
	    <image source="images/3d-plane-span-yes" />
	  </sidebyside>
	  Once again, the matrix
	  <me>
	    \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	    \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2
	    \end{array}\right]
	    = 
	    \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	    1 \amp 0 \\
	    1 \amp 2 \\
	    -1 \amp 1 \\
	    \end{array}\right]
	    \sim
	    \left[\begin{array}{rr}
	    1 \amp 0 \\
	    0 \amp 1 \\
	    0 \amp 0 \\
	    \end{array}\right]
	  </me>
	  has two pivot positions.
	  </p></li>

	  <li> <p>
	    Finally, we looked at a set of vectors whose matrix
	    <me>
	      \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	      \vvec_1 \amp \vvec_2 \amp \vvec_3
	      \end{array}\right]
	      = \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	      1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	      1 \amp 2 \amp -2 \\
	      -1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \\
	      \end{array}\right]
	      \sim
	      \left[\begin{array}{rrr}
	      1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \\
	      0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \\
	      0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	      \end{array}\right]	      
	    </me>
	    has three pivot positions, one in every row.  This is
	    significant because it means that if we consider an
	    augmented matrix
	    <me>
	      \left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
	      1 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp *\\
	      1 \amp 2 \amp -2 \amp * \\
	      -1 \amp 1 \amp 4 \amp * \\
	      \end{array}\right]
	      \sim
	      \left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
	      1 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp *\\
	      0 \amp 1 \amp 0 \amp * \\
	      0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp * \\
	      \end{array}\right]
	    </me>,
	    there cannot be a pivot position in the rightmost column.
	    This linear system is consistent for every vector
	    <m>\bvec</m>, which tells us that
	    <m>\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\vvec_3} = \real^3</m>.
	  </p></li>
	</ul>
      </p>

      <p> To summarize, we looked at the pivot positions in the matrix
      whose columns were the vectors
      <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m>.  We found that with
      <ul>
	<li> <p> one pivot position, the span was a line. </p> </li>
	<li> <p> two pivot positions, the span was a plane. </p></li>
	<li> <p> three pivot positions, the span was
	<m>\real^3</m>. </p></li> 
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
	Once again, we will develop these ideas more fully in the next
	and subsequent sections.  However, we saw that, when
	considering vectors in <m>\real^3</m>, a pivot position in
	every row implied that the span of the vectors is
	<m>\real^3</m>.  The same reasoning applies more generally.
      </p>

      <proposition xml:id="prop-pivot-row">
	<statement>
	  <p> Suppose we have vectors
	  <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> in <m>\real^m</m>.
	  Then <m>\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n}=\real^m</m>
	  if and only if the matrix
	  <m>\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	  \vvec_1\amp\vvec_2\amp\ldots\amp\vvec_n
	  \end{array}\right]
	  </m> has a pivot position in every row.
	  </p>
	</statement>
      </proposition>

      <p>
	This tells us something important about the number of vectors
	needed to span <m>\real^m</m>.  Suppose we have <m>n</m> vectors
	<m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> that span
	<m>\real^m</m>.  The proposition tells us that the matrix
	<m> A = \left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	\vvec_1\amp\vvec_2\ldots\vvec_n
	\end{array}\right]
	</m> has a pivot position in every row, such as in this
	reduced row echelon matrix.
	<me>
	  \left[\begin{array}{rrrrrr}
	  1 \amp 0 \amp * \amp 0 \amp * \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 1 \amp * \amp 0 \amp * \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \amp * \amp 0 \\
	  0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 0 \amp 1 \\
	  \end{array}\right]
	</me>.
	Since a matrix can have at most one pivot position in a
	column, there must be at least as many columns as there are
	rows, which implies that <m>n\geq m</m>.  
      </p>

      <p>
	For instance, if we have a set of vectors that span
	<m>\real^{632}</m>, there must be at least 632 vectors in the
	set.
      </p>

      <proposition>
	<statement>
	  <p> If a set of vectors span <m>\real^m</m>, there must be
	  at least <m>m</m> vectors in the set.</p>
	</statement>
      </proposition>

      <p>
	This makes sense intuitively.  We have thought about a linear
	combination of a set of vectors
	<m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> as the result of walking
	a certain distance in the direction of <m>\vvec_1</m>,
	followed by walking a certain distance in the direction of
	<m>\vvec_2</m>, and so on.  If
	<m>\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n} = \real^m</m>, this
	means that we can walk to any point in <m>\real^m</m> using the
	directions <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m>.  It makes
	sense that we would need at least <m>m</m> directions to give
	us the flexibilty needed to reach any point in <m>\real^m</m>.

      Summary
    </title>

    <p> We defined the span of a set of vectors and developed some
    intuition for this concept through a series of examples.

    <ul>
      <li> <p> The span of a set of vectors
      <m>\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n</m> is the set of linear
      combinations of the vectors.  We denote the span by
      <m>\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n}</m>.
      </p></li>

      <li> <p> A vector <m>\bvec</m> is in
      <m>\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n}</m> if an only if the
      linear system
      <me>
	\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	\vvec_1\amp\vvec_2\amp\ldots\vvec_n
	\end{array}\right]
	\xvec = \bvec
      </me>
      is consistent. </p></li>

      <li> <p> If the <m>m\times n</m> matrix
      <me>
	\left[\begin{array}{rrrr}
	\vvec_1\amp\vvec_2\amp\ldots\vvec_n
	\end{array}\right]
      </me>
      has a pivot in every row, then the span of these vectors is
      <m>\real^m</m>;  that is,
      <m>\laspan{\vvec_1,\vvec_2,\ldots,\vvec_n} =
