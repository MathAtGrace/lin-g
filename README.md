## Getting started

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Copy `Makefile.paths.original` to `Makefile.paths` and edit
`Makefile.paths` as instructed within that file. 
3.  Use `make html` to create the html version or `make latex` to make
a `pdflatex` file.

## Please note

The `Makefile`s were shamelessly stolen from Matt Boelkins' *Active
Calculus* repository.  Thanks to Matt and others for their work
setting up the development environment.  Any errors here are, of
course, my own.
